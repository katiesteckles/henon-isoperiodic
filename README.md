# henon-isoperiodic
Visualisation of periodic orbits in the HÃ©non map

Based on the code at https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/Chaos/gallas.htm

Goals:
- Understand how the diagrams are generated
- Produce a more user-friendly version of the two generated diagrams (I *think* the second one is just zoomed in on part of the first one) with a/b values marked on the sides, and maybe an output that shows the a/b value of a point you're hovering on, and the periodicity at that point
- Maaaybe, set it up so you can toggle a plot of the line b=0.3035, 0.91 < a < 1.41 on the diagram? Or, other lines of your choice?!? Dream world
