# henon-isoperiodic
Visualisation of periodic orbits in the HÃ©non map

Based on the code at https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/Chaos/gallas.htm

Goals:
- Work out how the diagrams are generated so I can write an explanation of this and understand what we're seeing
- Produce a more user-friendly version of the two generated diagrams (I *think* the second one is just zoomed in on part of the first one) with a/b values marked along the sides, and maybe an output that shows the a/b value of a point you're hovering on, and the periodicity at that point
- Get rid of the other stuff on the page to make it less confusing
- Maaaybe, set it up so you can toggle a plot of the line b=0.3035, 0.91 < a < 1.41 on the diagram? Or, other lines of your choice?!? Dream world
