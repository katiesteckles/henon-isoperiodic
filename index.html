    <p>
      The two-parameter diffeomorphism of Henon is <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
      <i>x' = -x<sup>2</sup> + by + a <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; y' = x</i>. <br />The
      parameter space of the Henon map is organized in a very regular way.
      Complicated pleopodic shrimplike structures are shown below. Every shrimp
      consists of a main body of periodicity <i>k</i> plus an infinite
      succession of adjacent domains having periods <i>k 2<sup>n</sup></i
      >, i.e., following a period-doubling route to chaos from the main body
      <i>k</i>. Most of shrimps consist of four main legs made of infinite
      number of continuous and smouth segments resulting from intersections with
      legs from other shrimps.

    Click mouse in window to find period <i>p</i> of the point. Click mouse +
    <i>&lt;Alt&gt;</i>(<i>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</i>) to Zoom In(Out) 2 times. Hold
    <i>&lt;Shift&gt;</i> to modify Zoom In/Out x4

    <p>
      A striking regularity is that essentially all isoperiodic shrimps appear
      aligned along a very particular direction <i>&#945;</i> defined by the
      (red) line <i>b = - 0.583a + 1.025</i> (see Fig.1 at the bottom). A
      portion of the line you see above. This pictures is a magnified view of a
      domain around the <i>8'</i>-shrimp in the second applet. The dense
      "foliation" of roughly parallel lines seen to the left and to the right of
      the <i>8'</i>-shrimp in the second applet originated from shrimps located
      almost exclusively along <i>&#945;</i>. There are also a secondary
      <i>&#946;</i> direction "perpendicular" to all legs going down and a
      further direction, defined by thouse legs going to the right.

    <br />From the picture one recognizes that most of the dynamics known for
    unimodal maps (exemplified here for the quadratic map along <i>b = 0</i>)
    corresponds to "traversing the foliation of legs" coming down from shrimps
    located in the domain above. The apparently random way with which periodic
    windows appear embadded in the chaotic domain along <i>b = 0</i> is in fact
    a consequence of the ordering of shrimps along <i>a</i>.

    <p>
      <i>A remark</i> Due to slow convergence near the period doubling
      bifurcations there are black strips between zones of different
      periodicities. As since shrimps are rather slow the last applet makes only
      <i>300</i>
      iterations in every pixel.
